            <h3>The Textbooks are Sold</h3>
            <p>
               The textbooks take one of three paths to maximize their value:
               <ol>
                  <li>Textbooks are sold in various marketplaces to find the
                  best value.</li>
                  <li>Non-sell-able textbooks are given to other non-profit
                  causes (e.g. literacy-promoting causes, Goodwill, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Poor condition textbooks are recycled, saving them from
                  the landfill.</li>
               </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>The Proceeds are Given to your Cause</h3>
            <p>
               The proceeds from textbook sales are donated as you directed to
               positive, nonprofit efforts locally and globally.

               fundraising the world is affected for the better by nonprofit
